        <h2>Forest's Bane</h2>
        <div class="project-content">
            <p>Forest's Bane is an independent game developer who creates emotional, character-driven experiences supported by thoughtful systemic design. His work is defined by worlds that shift according to the minds of the characters who inhabit them. Everything the player sees is shaped by perspective, resulting in settings that feel personal, unstable, and deeply human. Although his stories often touch on dark or unsettling themes, he approaches them with a light and playful tone that allows players to explore heavy ideas without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
            <p>Working almost entirely on his own, Alexander handles every aspect of development. He designs the mechanics, writes the narrative, creates the art, composes the sound, and builds the systems that hold everything together. His games frequently involve careful strategy and decision-making, often under conditions of mystery or incomplete information. Players are encouraged to weigh uncertain options, navigate moral ambiguity, and rely on both intuition and logic.</p>
            <p>Across his portfolio, Alexander focuses on worldbuilding that feels lived-in and characters who leave a lasting impression. His goal is to craft experiences that resonate emotionally and inspire curiosity, creating stories that linger in the mind long after they end.</p>
            <p>Those who reach this page often want a deeper look at the craft behind his games. Alexander approaches each project as an ongoing effort to refine his voice, his systems, and his worlds. He hopes that exploring this site gives visitors a clear sense of that progression and an understanding of the care behind each new idea.</p>
